# VRM-Normal-Map-Generator
Automatically generate and assign normal maps for VRoid VRM models.
(Only works with VRM 1.0 models for now)

## Usage
After installation, it'll be located under the VRM tab (same tab where your VRM addon is found under).
Untick any category of texture you want to be left alone, adjust the strength of the normal map, press Invert if you need different results, and then press Generate Normal Maps.
The procedure is pretty slow, but there is a progress bar.

This was made so that RPG Developer Bakin users can easily add Normal maps for their models, but it can be used for any other situation.

This removes what was assigned as a normal map on the VRM model with the new result. Export as a VRM for the software of your choice.

## To Do
- Add a prompt to filter out specific materials after starting (ex: disable skirt normals, top, etc).

Thanks to Grok 3 as usual for being a very helpful tool.
